This is an attempt to use the LCD CFA835 from Crystalfontz. This device features a 244 x 68 pixel backlit LCD screen and has 6 buttons (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ENTER, EXIT).

In addition to implementing functionality based on the specifications provided by Crystalfontz, I have developed a mechanism to use this device as a complete application. This application includes several main components such as a layout system, text rendering, image display, and a progress bar.

The code utilizes fonts created with the Crystalfontz Font Editor. However, after creation, the font appears somewhat broken due to the limited number of pixels available on the screen. The recommended approach for better rendering is to use a bitmap file containing a single character for each supported text size, and then assemble these characters together to render entire sentences. While this method provides a better appearance, it introduces a problem: when the screen is cleared and re-rendered with new data 30 times per second, the device cannot handle the rate and will display an empty screen between each clear and re-render.

The effort required to optimize the device to work properly is excessive. The time spent on this could be better invested in other, more important projects of mine, rather than dealing with this costly inconvenience ($135 USD).
